That’s easy once you’ve installed and configured babel.

Install React with:

npm i react react-dom --save-dev
Next up add babel-preset-react:

npm i babel-preset-react --save-dev
Configure the preset in .babelrc:

{
  "presets": ["env", "react"]
}
and you’re good to go!

As suggested by Conner Aiken you can configure babel-loader to read .jsx files too. This is useful if you’re using the jsx extension for your React components.

Open up webpack.config.jsand configure the loader like so:

module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.(js|jsx)$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        use: {
          loader: "babel-loader"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
};
To test things out you can create a dummy React component in ./src/App.js:

import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>React here!</p>
    </div>
  );
};
export default App;
ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("app"));
Next up import the component in ./src/index.js:

import App from "./App";
and run the build again.
