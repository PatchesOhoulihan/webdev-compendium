webpack 4 as a zero configuration module bundler
webpack is powerful and has a lot of unique features but one of its pain point is the configuration file.

Providing a configuration for webpack is not a big deal in medium to bigger projects. You can’t live without one. Yet, for smaller ones it’s kind of annoying, especially when you want to kickstart some toy app.

That’s why Parcel gained a lot of traction.

Here’s the breaking news now: webpack 4 doesn’t need a configuration file by default!

Let’s try that out.

webpack 4: getting started with zero conf
Create a new directory and move into it:

mkdir webpack-4-quickstart && cd $_
Initialize a package.json by running:

npm init -y
and pull webpack 4 in:

npm i webpack --save-dev
We need webpack-cli also, which lives as a separate package:

npm i webpack-cli --save-dev
Now open up package.json and add a build script:

"scripts": {
  "build": "webpack"
}
Close the file and save it.

Try to run:

npm run build
and see what happens:

ERROR in Entry module not found: Error: Can't resolve './src' in '~/webpack-4-quickstart'
webpack 4 is looking for an entry point in ./src! If you don’t know what that means go check out my previous article on switching from Gulp to webpack.

In brief: the entry point is the file webpack looks for to start building your Javascript bundle.

In the previous version of webpack the entry point has to be defined inside a configuration file named webpack.config.js.

But starting from webpack 4 there is no need to define the entry point: it will take ./src/index.js as the default!

Testing the new feature is easy. Create ./src/index.js:

console.log(`I'm a silly entry point`);
and run the build again:

npm run build
You will get the bundle in ~/webpack-4-quickstart/dist/main.js.

What? Wait a moment. There is no need to define the output file? Exactly.

In webpack 4 there is no need to define neither the entry point, nor the output file.

webpack’s main strength is code splitting. But trust me, having a zero configuration tool speeds things up.

So here is the first news: webpack 4 doesn’t need a configuration file.

It will look in ./src/index.js as the default entry point. Moreover, it will spit out the bundle in ./dist/main.js.

In the next section we’ll see another nice feature of webpack 4: production and development mode.
