Modern Javascript is mostly written in ES6.

But not every browser know how to deal with ES6. We need some kind of transformation.

This transformation step is called transpiling. Transpiling is the act of taking ES6 and making it understandable by older browsers.

Webpack doesn’t know how to make the transformation but has loaders: think of them as of transformers.

babel-loader is the webpack loader for transpiling ES6 and above, down to ES5.

To start using the loader we need to install a bunch of dependencies. In particular:

babel-core
babel-loader
babel-preset-env for compiling Javascript ES6 code down to ES5
Let’s do it:

npm i babel-core babel-loader babel-preset-env --save-dev
Next up configure Babel by creating a new file named .babelrc inside the project folder:

{
    "presets": [
        "env"
    ]
}
At this point we have 2 options for configuring babel-loader:

using a configuration file for webpack
using --module-bindin your npm scripts
Yes, I know what you’re thinking. webpack 4 markets itself as a zero configuration tool. Why would you write a configuration file again?

The concept of zero configuration in webpack 4 applies to:

the entry point. Default to ./src/index.js
the output. Default to ./dist/main.js
production and development mode (no need to create 2 separate confs for production and development)
And it’s enough. But for using loaders in webpack 4 you still have to create a configuration file.

I’ve asked Sean about this. Will loaders in webpack 4 work the same as webpack 3? Is there any plan to provide 0 conf for common loaders like babel-loader?

His response:

“For the future (after v4, maybe 4.x or 5.0), we have already started the exploration of how a preset or addon system will help define this. What we don’t want: To try and shove a bunch of things into core as defaults What we do want: Allow other to extend”

For now you must still rely on webpack.config.js. Let’s take a look…

webpack 4: using babel-loader with a configuration file
Give webpack a configuration file for using babel-loader in the most classical way.

Create a new file named webpack.config.jsand configure the loader:

module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.js$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        use: {
          loader: "babel-loader"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
};
There is no need to specify the entry point unless you want to customize it.

Next up open ./src/index.js and write some ES6:

const arr = [1, 2, 3];
const iAmJavascriptES6 = () => console.log(...arr);
window.iAmJavascriptES6 = iAmJavascriptES6;
Finally create the bundle with:

npm run build
Now take a look at ./dist/main.js to see the transpiled code.
