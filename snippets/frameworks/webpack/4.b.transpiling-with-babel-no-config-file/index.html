webpack 4: using babel-loader without a configuration file
There is another method for using webpack loaders.

The --module-bindflag lets you specify loaders from the command line. Thank you Cezar for pointing this out.

The flag is not webpack 4 specific. It was there since version 3.

To use babel-loader without a configuration file configure your npm scripts in package.json like so:

"scripts": {
    "dev": "webpack --mode development --module-bind js=babel-loader",
    "build": "webpack --mode production --module-bind js=babel-loader"
  }
And you’re ready to run the build.

I’m not a fan of this method (I don’t like fat npm scripts) but it is interesting nonetheless.
